# Atlas API Post-ticketing

## **Do we get notified when there is a change in flight schedule for our customers?**

Sometimes airlines can make changes to their flight schedule. These changes range from minor changes in flight schedules to major ones such as cancellation or rerouting.
In this case, the airline will send the message to the contact email or mobile number of this booking.



## **How is the post-ticketing process being handled?**

Atlas API supports the post-ticketing process. The API allows for post-ticketing functions such as purchasing ancillary services, cancellation requests and processing refunds. Please refer to the API Reference section for further information. You can also reach out to our API support team or the Customer Service Centre to investigate any post-ticketing queries.



## **Is there a refund claim process for Atlas customers?**

The refund claim process differs as per the mode of payment. Please refer to the process as per the payment mode:


Mode of Payment: **Deposit**

1. When the refund has been initiated by customers via Atlas, Atlas will process the refund and keep a track of the refund status. Customers can request Atlas for the refund status.
   
2. When customers or the passenger submits the refund to the airline directly, customers can use the "Agent and Passenger Initiated Refund" feature in ATRIP to send Atlas a notification. Atlas will refund the ticket when Atlas receives the funds from the airline. Customers can also request Atlas for the refund status.

Mode of Payment: **VCC**

When the refund has been initiated by customers via Atlas OR when customers or the passenger submits the refund to the airline directly, the funds will be directly credited into customers VCC account by the airline. The card statement will show the credit into the account. Please note that for VCC mode of payment, the "Agent and Passenger Initiated Refund" feature should not be used.
