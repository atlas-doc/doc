# Order and Fulfillment Flow

## 1. Price Transparency​
- Display airline fares separately from other surcharges (including airline payment fees, Atlas service fees, and Subscriber's markup)​
- Price transparency must cover both flight fares and ancillary charges (bags, seats, etc.)​
- Ensure end users can clearly see Ryanair's actual price

## 2. Explicit Passenger Notifications​
- Customers must check boxes to accept Ryanair's terms of service, privacy policy, and cookie policy, and acknowledge they need to create or log in to a myRyanair account to manage bookings​
- Passengers must confirm their order on Ryanair's official website via a pop-up page before ticketing

## 3. Passenger Information Transmission​
- Must collect and transmit passengers' genuine contact information to Ryanair, including email & phone number​
- When creating orders, include the subscriber's email address so Ryanair can copy them on ticket confirmations and flight change notifications

## 4. Pre-ticketing Pop-up Confirmation
- Before ticketing, the system must display Ryanair's official website order confirmation page for passenger verification.
