# RyanAir (FR) UAT Submission Guide

In the stages of Search, Verify, Seat Selection, and Order, Ryanair's integration method is no different from that of other airlines. The main difference lies in the period after order creation and before payment. Users need to confirm the flight on the airline's webpage. Only after the customer's confirmation can the payment be successfully made and the ticket issued. 
However, we need to conduct UAT to validate the functionality, just as we do for any other application integration. You need to conduct UAT tests once you have integrated Atlas API with your booking and reservation system. 

Once you have integrated the API we need to test and confirm if the integration was successful. The attached **Atlas RyanAir (FR) UAT Test Shopping & Ticketing Services Only** template has four test scenarios we need you to submit. The test cases of the journey should include the combination of passenger types, trip types, direct or connecting flights and payment methods mentioned in the UAT template.

Please download the UAT template below, follow the steps, fill in the test results and submit the test results on ATRIP via the "Requests" section.
